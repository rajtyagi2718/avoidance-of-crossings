# Avoidance of Crossings

Theoretical analysis of Hermitian matrix-valued functions shows their eigenfunctions almost never collide. We randomly generate matrix-valued polynomial functions of arbitrary degree and size, then plot their eigenfunctions over time. A plot of a 20-dimensional matrix-valued polynomial of degree 5 is shown above. At time 0 the polynomial reduces to its constant factor, and the eigenvalues are shown to coalesce. At various other times, adjacent eigenfunctions attract but almost always repel before a collision.

We further demonstrate the near zero probability of any such collision. Empirical analysis supports the characterization of crossings as rare collisions in a lower dimensional subspace.
