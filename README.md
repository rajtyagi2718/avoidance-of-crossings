# avoidance-of-crossings
Theoretical analysis of Hermitian matrix-valued functions shows their eigenfunctions almost never collide.
Randomly generated matrices and plotted perturbations of their eigenfunctions.
Empirical analysis supported characterization of crossings as rare collisions in lower dimensional subspace.
