# Avoidance of Crossings

Theoretical analysis of Hermitian matrix-valued functions shows their eigenfunctions almost never collide. We randomly generate matrix-valued polynomial functions of arbitrary degree and size, then plot their eigenfunctions over time.

A plot of a 22-dimensional symmetric matrix-valued polynomial of degree 5 is shown above. The smallest and largest eigenfunctions are not shown for brevity. At time 0 the polynomial reduces to its constant factor, and the eigenvalues are shown to coalesce. At various other times, adjacent eigenfunctions attract and collide but always repel before crossing.

This phenomenon is called avoidance of crossings. Theoretical analysis characterizes crossings as rare collisions in a lower dimensional subspace.
